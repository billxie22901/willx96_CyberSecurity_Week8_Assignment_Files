# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Description: URL unsanatized. Puting %27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)=0--%27 into the Salesperson ID will execute the SQL Injection. In this case, waiting 5 seconds before moving going to the default salesperson.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
- Description: Session not secure and login info was forwarded to another site. I logged in to blue site and that also gave me access to red site.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Description: Though no actual exploit found regarding XSS on any site, I believe the most likely candidate would be the green site. I tried to contact all three sit with the script "<script>alert(â€™xss exploit found by willx96');</script>" and only the green site does not show the comment.
